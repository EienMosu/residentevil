<p><h3>About</h3>
<p>Resident Evil 3 is a 2020 survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom for Microsoft Windows,
    PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is a remake of the 1999 Resident Evil game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, and follows
    former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from
    a city that has been infected by a viral bioweapon. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder, third-person
    perspective and requires the player to solve puzzles and defeat opponents while being pursued by a
    creature called Nemesis.

    Most of Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 and both
    games run on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Although the game features the same premise as the
    original, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. To honor the more action-oriented
    approach of the original, developers revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2
    remake and added an ability for players to dodge incoming attacks. Because some features from the original
    game were excluded, a separate online multiplayer game, Resident Evil: Resistance, was bundled with Resident Evil 3.</p>
