<h1>Capcom U.S</h1>
<p>Capcom began in Japan in 1979 as a manufacturer and distributor of electronic game machines. <br>
    In 1983 Capcom Co., Ltd. was founded and soon built a reputation for introducing cutting-edge technology and
    highly memorable franchises to the video game market. <br> Now an industry leader in the video game industry,
    Capcom's legacy of historic franchises in home and arcade gaming are testaments to an unparalleled commitment
    to excellence.
    <br>
    <br>
    Building on its origins as a game machine manufacturer, Capcom is now involved in all areas
    of the video game industry. <br> Capcom maintains operations in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan and
    Tokyo, with corporate headquarters located in Osaka, Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    Groundbreaking franchises like Resident Evil™, Street Fighter™, Devil May Cry™, Monster Hunter™, <br> Ace Attorney™ and the
    Mega Man™ series set the standard in creative innovation, character development and unsurpassed gameplay. <br> Guided by
    the idea of fostering a culture of entertainment, <br> Capcom has consistently acted on this view by creating innovative
    and hugely popular games that push technical and creative limits.
    <br>
    <br>
    A charter member of the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), <br> Capcom develops products for all age groups and
    supports the programs and guidelines established by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).</p>
